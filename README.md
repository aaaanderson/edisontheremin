Edison Theremin - a basic musical instrument based on the Intel Edison.

A rotational switch controls pitch, and a capacitive button allows quiet
articulation. LEDs allow the user to silently know when they have crossed a
note boundary on the rotational switch, supporting quicker, more fluent play.
A digital button allows the user to switch between multiple predefined scales.
